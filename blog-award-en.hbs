        <hr/>
        <p class="post-full-custom-excerpt">We at the seventeen goals magazine believe that good work needs to be
            acknowledged! And to inspire talented bloggers and get more people involved in sustainable living, we have
            initiated the "17 Goals Blog Award‚Äù. With this we select and honour a blog post every month. We choose this
            on the basis of how this post contributes to achieving the goals, the impact it has on the readers and last
            but not the least its creativity and journalistic skills exhibited in the post. </p>
